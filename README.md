# Understand Visitor Design Pattern

This repo is my playground exploring the Visitor pattern

This pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to perform operations on objects of a structure without modifying their classes.

Itâ€™s particularly useful when classes are stable on their main purpose but there need to perform unrelated or unstable operations.

Here are some examples of use cases:
* Extending functionality without modifying classes (e.g., library classes or stable structures).  
* Performing different operations on elements of a complex object structure (e.g., parsing ASTs).
* When you have a set of related classes and need to perform a set of varied but related operations on them.
* Avoiding bloated classes where numerous unrelated methods are added.
* Simplifying the addition of new operations while maintaining backward compatibility.
* Gathering information or performing transformations over a collection of objects with different types (e.g., serialization, validation, or reporting).

I would describe this as a plug and play system.
